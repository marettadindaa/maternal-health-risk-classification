# Maternal Health Risk Classification
Data Mining Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying maternal health risk levels using machine learning techniques. The analysis is conducted on the Maternal Health Risk Dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains clinical and physiological indicators related to maternal mortality risk.

The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, perform data preprocessing, and build classification models to accurately predict maternal health risk levels.

## Dataset Information
* Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
* Total Records: 1,014
* Features: 7 variables
* Target Variable: RiskLevel (Low Risk, Mid Risk, High Risk)

| Feature     | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Age         | Age of the pregnant woman (years) |
| SystolicBP  | Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)    |
| DiastolicBP | Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)   |
| BS          | Blood sugar level (mmol/L)        |
| BodyTemp    | Body temperature (°F)             |
| HeartRate   | Heart rate (beats per minute)     |
| RiskLevel   | Maternal health risk category     |

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Identified numerical and categorical variables
* Conducted correlation analysis using a correlation matrix and heatmap
* Analyzed the distribution of the target variable (RiskLevel)
* Observed that SystolicBP and DiastolicBP have a strong positive correlation

## Tools & Technologies
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
